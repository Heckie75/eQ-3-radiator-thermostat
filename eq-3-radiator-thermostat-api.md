```


## Read current status and mode, sync time

It is possible to request some status information of the thermostat, i.e.
- current mode
- target temperature
- current level of valve
- and details of vacation mode

Requesting the current status and mode requires to set the current date and time explicitly.

Therefore the request is as follows:
```
char-write-req 0411 03110208151f05
               |    | + Byte 2 to 7: yy-mm-day hh-MM-ss in hex
               |    +-- Byte 1: request command "03"
               + request via handle 411
```

Data will be returned via notification handle. Newer devices (firmwares > 1.1) always return all details of the device. Older devices only return bytes 7 to 10 if vacation mode is active. Bytes 11 to 15 are not available at all.

```
Notification handle = 0x0421 value: 02 01 09 50 04 1e 00 00 00 00 18 03 2a 22 07
                                    |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  + temperature offset, calculate (value -  7) / 2

                                    |  |  |  |  |  |  + if vacation mode: day in month
                                    |  |  |  |  |  + target temperature, calculate value / 2
                                    |  |  |  |  + (unknown)
                                    |  |  |  + Valve in percent 
                                    |  |  + Mode, see bits in API for details
                                    |  + 0x01 if this notification is device status notification
                                    + Always 0x02 if this notification is device status notification
```

**Note**: It does not seem to be possible to set the "daylight summertime" (dst) via bluetooth. 

### Modes (Byte 3)
The thermostat has the following modes which can be active at one and the same time:
- "auto"        - Bit 1 is not set (mask 0x00)
- "manual"      - Bit 1 is set (mask 0x01)
- "vacation"    - Bit 2 is set (mask 0x02)
- "boost"       - Bit 3 is set (mask 0x04)
- "dst"         - Bit 4 is set (mask 0x08)
- "open window" - Bit 5 is set (mask 0x10)
- "locked"      - Bit 6 is set (mask 0x20)
- "unknown"     - Bit 7 is set (mask 0x40)
- "low battery" - Bit 8 is set (mask 0x80)

### Valve (Byte 4)
Byte 4 represents the percentage value of the valve. However, I haven't seen a value more than 80% in normal operation even if boost mode is running. If thermostat is switched to "on" it is really 100%.

### Current target temperature (Byte 6)
Byte 6 represents the target temperature. It has to be calculated.

```
temp = dec(value of byte 6) / 2.0
```  

### Vacation data (bytes 7 - 10)

Bytes related to vacation mode:
- Byte 8: Vacation year (yy) in hex
- Byte 9: Vacation month (mm) in hex
- Byte 7: Vacation day in month (dd) in hex
- Byte 10: Vacation time in 30 minutes steps in hex. Time can be calculated like this:
```
hh = int(dec(value of byte 10) / 2)
mm = dec(value of byte 10) modulo 2 * 30
```

**Example 1 - auto mode**

```

### Activate boost mode
You can turn on the boost mode by the following command. Boost mode will be activated for 5 minutes until it stops. 
Unfortunately it does not seem to be possible to read the ETA before boost mode turns off automatically. 

Request
```
char-write-req 0411 45ff
               |    | +---------- Byte 2: Any value greater or equal than 1 starts boost mode. Values don't seem to make a difference.
               |    +------------ Byte 1: "45" indicates request in order to start boost mode
               + request via handle 411
```

```

### Stop boost mode
Turn off the boost mode by the following command.

Request
```
char-write-req 0411 4500
               |    | +---------- Byte 2: "00" stops boost mode. All values greater than 0 start boost mode.
               |    +------------ Byte 1: "45" indicates request in order to start boost mode

                                          + mode, now back to "normal"
```

## Timer
The thermostat has at least one time plan per day. In other forums you can read that there are even more timer programs possible but I haven't double-checked it. 
From my point of view it is good enough to have the possibility to have a schedule plan for each day of the week. 

Timers can be read and written via bluetooth. 

### Read timer for a day
The programmed timers can be read for every single day. There can be up to 7 changes of temperature per day.

Request
```
char-write-req 0411 2002
               |    | +---------- Byte 2: "00" day which will be queried, starting with "00" for Saturday and "06" for Friday
               |    +------------ Byte 1: "20" indicates request in order to request timer for given day
               + request via handle 411
```

The thermostat returns the data for timer of that day via notification handle 0x0421:
```

                                    +----------------------------------------------- Byte 1: Always "21"
```

#### Timer schema
- Byte 2: Day of timer
- Byte 3: Temperature between midnight and first event 

n = No. of event which must be between 1 and 7

- Byte 2 * n + 2: Encoded time of event n in 10 minutes steps in hex. If it is the last event it must be "24:00" (hex: "90")
- Byte 2 * n + 1: Temperature between event n - 1 and event n

It seems to be very important that:
1.  The time of the final event must have the value for "24:00"
2.  All events after the final event must be filled with zeros!

#### Days (Byte 2)
- 00 = Saturday
- 01 = Sunday
- 02 = Monday
- 03 = Tuesday
- 04 = Wednesday
- 05 = Thursday
- 06 = Friday

#### Time in timer
The time is encoded in intervals of 10 minutes.
```
hh = int(dec(value of byte) / 6)
mm = dec(value of byte 10) modulo 6 * 10
```

#### Temperature
The temperature is encoded in intervals of 0.5
```
temp = dec(value of byte) / 2.0
```  

### Set timer for a day
Setting of a timer program for a weekday is very simular to reading timers.

## Configuration
### Configure comfort and eco temperature
The comfort temperature (sun symbol) and the eco temperature (night symbol) will be programmed by a single request. 

Request
```
char-write-req 0411 112b23
               |    | | |

```

### Offset temperature
The offest temperature is encoded in intervals of 0.5 starting at -3.5°C
```
value of byte = hex((temp + 3.5) * 2.0)
```  

## Others

### Lock thermostat
The thermostat can be locked by this request:

Request
```
char-write-req 0411 8001
               |    | |
               |    | |
               |    | +------------------------------ Byte 2: "01" for lock thermostat
               |    +-------------------------------- Byte 1: "80" indicates request in order to lock/unlock thermostat
               + request via handle 411
```

The thermostat returns status via notification handle simular to the normal status that we have seen before:
```
Notification handle = 0x0421 value: 02 01 00 00 04 2a
```

### Unlock thermostat
The thermostat can be locked by this request:

Request
```
char-write-req 0411 8000
               |    | |
               |    | |
               |    | +------------------------------ Byte 2: "00" for unlock thermostat
               |    +-------------------------------- Byte 1: "80" indicates request in order to lock/unlock thermostat
               + request via handle 411
```

The thermostat returns status via notification handle simular to the normal status that we have seen before:
```
Notification handle = 0x0421 value: 02 01 00 00 04 2a
```

### Read latest command request
As you have seen all commands will be pushed via write request on handle 0x0411. The thermostat seems to remember the value that has been pushed before so that you can read it afterwards via char-read-hnd.

This was also very helpful in order to understand what the official app sends to the thermostat ;-)

```
char-read-hnd 0411

Characteristic value/descriptor: 03 11 02 09 14 2e 2e 90 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 
```

**Note** The thermostat does not overwrite the whole value. It overwrites just the length of bytes that has been sent. Therefore you should clear the buffer before use it for analysis. See next.

```
char-write-req 0411 00000000000000000000000000000000
```

### Factory reset 
In other forums I have read that there is this command in order to reset the thermostat to factory settings. Actually I haven't double-checked it. 

Request
```
char-write-req 0411 f0
```

Since I haven't tried it out, I don't know what the thermostat will do afterwards. 

### What's about the PIN that everyone of us has entered?
I don't know. There is nothing to do in order to control the thermostat via bluetooth and gatttool!
Seems to be fake ;-)
